 * COLORINGMAX course content — the first creator course.
 *
 * Source: "Clay's Coloring Guide" (Coloring Max for brown/tan skin).
 * Authored by the creator "Clay". See ./courseContent.ts for the schema.
 *
 * Core framework (preserved verbatim in spirit): brighten, don't lighten —
 * make your natural coloring look cleaner, brighter, and more intentional
 * across skin, lips, eyes, teeth, hair, facial hair, and light. Never about
 * becoming lighter; always about raising the quality of the tone you have.
 *
 * NB: strings use double quotes throughout because the copy is full of
 * apostrophes/contractions — avoids escaping noise in 43 lessons of content.
